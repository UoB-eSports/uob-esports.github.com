The University of Brighton eSports Society was founded September 2014, and is the University's first competitive gaming society.

Our aim is to enable students who wish to take their gaming experience to the next level by competing against players with a much higher skill threshold, as well as competing for physical prizes.

The Society is currently composed of five League of Legends teams, two Dota 2 teams, a Counter Strike team and a number of Hearthstone and StarCraft 2 players.

We are not only limited to holding and entering PC events. The Society is currently looking to expand into the console scene with games such as Super Smash Bros, Call of Duty and Fifa.
