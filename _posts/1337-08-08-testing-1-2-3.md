We've been hard at work expanding the website to feature society content and announcements for your perusal!

Thanks to Oscar 'Oska' Pelling and Jack 'Major Pain' Gould for contributing our two first articles (located [here][league] and [here][dota]), if you'd like to contribute new content to the site be sure to get in touch with Oliver 'TH3 SP00F3R' Eddleston at [oliver@uobesports.com][oliver].

On the other hand, if you're interested in the inner workings of this website and want to help out with adding new features, get in touch with Yann 'アウネ' Eves at [yann@uobesports.com][yann].
