The Brighton eSports society gets off to a great start in the [NUEL][nuel] tournament last Sunday. Brighton White achieves a perfect record, wining all three of their matches. As they are the highest seeded team they faced the toughest opposition which makes this feat all the more impressive.

Tom 'siryoloswagalot' Shepherd pulled out an unusual pick with mid lane Veigar which caught the enemy off guard and helped the team to their perfect record. Brij Patel the Brighton White jungler spoke to me about their ambitions for the NUEL "We will always aim to be undefeated, but this is unlikely, however [we will] always aim to finish in the top 3-4 teams"

Brighton Orange had a bye in the first game and then went on to win their their next two matches. The new Orange mid-laner Joao 'Mobabro' Correia showed up in both games and was a large factor in the team's success. Joe 'Jim B00b' Morris also channelled his inner Kikis playing a jungle Twisted Fate in both games that baffled both the team and the enemies as a global TP tank that hands out stuns like there's no tomorrow and still deals plenty of damage.

Both the Brighton Orange top-laner Callum 'chunkychips' Martin and the Brighton White top-laner Kyle 'Wafer' Palmer favour the Sion top-lane pick (which I'm sure you probably heard about at the social) . The pick was successful for both players with Callum's great performance on Sion acting as a damage sponge and Kyle achieving a perfect game (not including the tactical death at level 1 to jungle creeps).

Following an unfortunate evening of losses the Brighton Black team has disbanded. The decision was made by team captain Thomas Tang.

Brighton Blue didnt get off to the best start with two losses and a win but they showed some promise with some great dragon steals by 'Hannesbier'.

That concludes the recap of last weeks games, good luck to everyone competing tonight!
