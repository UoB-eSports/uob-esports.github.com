This year's Dota 2 New Bloom event to celebrate Chinese New Year comes in the form of the [Year Beast Brawl][yearbeast].

Firstly, let's get some background on this new game mode.

This mode involves a normal un-ranked all pick match with a slight – quite considerably game breaking – twist, this change is that at the 5 minute mark of each Year Beast Brawl game a Year Beast spawns in each team's fountain (respawn point) – Radiant & Dire.

Before the game starts you must choose an upgrade path to research and upgrade later in the game using points gathered through either purchases, recycling items or hard labour; winning Year Beast games.  

The upgrade paths are follows:

### Combat

- **LVL 1**: Bash: The Beast gains a 12% chance to stun attacked enemies for 1 second.
- **LVL 2**: Spiked Carapace: If 2 or more heroes are within 500 range of the Beast, the Beast will stun and reflect damage if attacked.
    - _Berserker's Call_: If there are 2 or more heroes within 300 range of the Beast, they will be forced to attack it for 2.5 seconds.
- **LVL 3**: Greater Hex: The Beast unleashes a magical smoke that expands outward in a 1000 radius, turning enemy units into harmless pigs for 4 seconds.

### Speed

- **LVL 1**: Attack Speed Aura: Allied units gain 30 attack speed in a 900 radius around the Beast.
- **LVL 2**: Stampede: If there are 2 or more enemy Heroes within 500 range of the Year Beast, it causes a Stampede, and all friendly units gain haste and phase for 3 seconds.
- **LVL 3**: Refresher Aura: When an allied hero casts a spell within 900 range of the Beast, that spell has a 50% chance to be instantly refreshed.

### Support

- **LVL 1**: Healing Aura: Heals 10 HP every 2 seconds in an 1100 area of effect around the Beast.
- **LVL 2**: True Sight: Grants truesight in an 1100 radius. The Beast will use Mekansm and Arcane Boots every 35 seconds in a 750 radius. Smoke Aura: While standing near the Beast, heroes are smoked.
- **LVL 3**: If a hero dies in an 1100 radius of the Beast, it will be resurrected after 3 seconds. This effect can only happen once every 20 seconds.

When the Year Beast spawns the game will descend into chaos as each team then proceeds to group up and charge headlong down a lane with their Year Beast in tow, this sometimes results in spectacular confrontations where full 12 man wipes occur frequently or a race to the finish sometimes occurs when the teams don't clash horns. Due to the Year Beast's early game potential it is very easy for a game to not last for more than 10 minutes if the teams decide to _base race_.

If the game progresses past this point things then tend to become evermore interesting if the Year Beast is levelled up to Level 3. This is when everything goes manic.

With **Combat LVL 3** you can render an enemy team, creeps AND Year Beast completely useless for 4 seconds in a vast AoE.

With **Support LVL 3** you can have one dead ally revive once ever 20 seconds during a teamfight within a vast AoE.

This is possibly the most game breaking of all..

With **Speed LVL 3** you can cast a spell and have a 50% chance of instantly refreshing it. This effect can be activated numerous times in succession – each refreshed use diminishes the chance slightly.

I've had quite a few experiences with this event and it my opinion it all comes down to how well organised your team is and how quick and how good your picks are. For example: Sniper, Undying, Warlock and Zeus are almost always instantly picked so these are a must if you're to be guaranteed success.

My ideal line-up for a game of Year Beast Brawl is:

- **Outworld Devourer**; _Essence Aura_ is ridiculously good with casters.
- **Sniper**; He is a very good hero for quickly bringing down the Year Beast.
- **Undying**; _Tombstone_ and _Soul Rip_ are very good in teamfights.
- **Warlock**; _Fatal Bonds_ and _Upheaval_ are really good vs. pushes.
- **Zeus**; He is easily the best hero for this. _Static Field_ is a game changer.

However, if you don't get these heroes it's not the end of the world. There are other really good heroes for this game mode, such as: Axe, Dazzle, Enigma, Invoker, Necrophos, Omniknight, Razor, Troll Warlord, and Winter Wyvern.

My best experience in the Year Beast Brawl came 5 days into the event. Our line-up was: me playing Zeus, **Louis** playing Undying, **Hai Teng 'ChineseAlan' Su** as Outworld Devourer, **Vince 'dez' Still** as Bristleback and **Harry 'harrytomlomsom' Tomlinson** playing Necrophos. This was the most manic game of the event so far. As soon as minute five hit and the Year Beast spawned 5 of us charged down top with the Beast in tow straight into a teamfight. We win the fight with ease and continue onto their towers, they try to defend but fail because they carelessly lost their Year Beast in the earlier teamfight. We take the tower then back off after some indecisiveness on whether to carry on pushing. At the 10-minute mark despite our dominance we're behind on towers, however, come the 16-minute mark we're slightly ahead thanks to a few very good teamfights and are currently pushing down their middle lane towers. 

At 20 minutes we're slightly leading on gold gain and experience gain but everything is very equal at this point. However, our secret weapon is about to be unleashed. Level 3 speed aura on our Year Beast courtesy of yours truly, this is where the game changes, we push straight through bottom lane no fear whatsoever, casting spells left right and centre for an eternity. The combination of Essence Aura and Refresher Aura paying dividends, we get one tower then lose horribly due to our overconfidence. Because of our arrogance we lose our top and bottom lane tier 2 towers. Now is time for a comeback, on the next Year Beast spawn we try our luck in middle lane. Even though we're more wary this time we still only trade our Year Beasts, but we do manage to grab a tower and come out on top with 2 of their heroes dying for 1 of ours.

The 30-minute Year Beast spawn is upon us, this is it, the all or nothing push. This time Refresher Aura pays dividends and we kill off 2 of them straight away with 4 successive Wrath of God casts from the Zeus, during the ensuing teamfight we win at every turn leaving no space for a comeback and destroyed any possible rays of hope that they might see forthcoming. We level every single structure within their home base wiping aside any attempt of salvage from the opposing team.

With the timer hitting 34 minutes we take the ancient and win the game. All in all it was a spectacular game within which there were moments of endless laughter and sometimes complete and utter frustration.

After the fact I looked up the stats for the game and up until we upgraded to LVL 3 Speed the game was completely even. So I say again, Refresher Aura will break any Year Beast Brawl game it is unlocked in.

### Conclusion

In conclusion this event is spectacular but only if you have a good game, otherwise it is a horrible thing to be a part of due to the frustrating ease with which a game can be lost.

Also, this year's New Bloom event pales in comparison with Valve's previous special Dota 2 events such as Wraith Night and the like because there is something fundamentally wrong with this special event that none of the other events I've played in and enjoyed have had. Versus. Aside from Diretide 2013 all the other events have been a co-operative team game where 5 players have taken on a boss and waves of creeps in the style of a Hero Defense game instead of a MOBA.

So I say to Valve, although these MOBA style special events can be fun given the right circumstances, I'd rather have a Hero Defense style of game mode for the special events as I enjoyed these games far more frequently, plus I never got bored of them whereas I'm now tired of Year Beast Brawl as I was with Diretide 2013.
